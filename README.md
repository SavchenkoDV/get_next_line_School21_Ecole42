# Get next line<br>

Created a function in C that reads from a file descriptor one line at a time, managing memory dynamically and supporting multiple open files simultaneously.
Implemented efficient buffer handling, static storage for each file descriptor, and logic for newline detection â€” all without using standard I/O functions.
